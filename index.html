            <h3><a href="#biography">Biography</a></h3>
            <p>My academic journey began with a bachelor's degree in Plant Pathology from the Agriculture College of Zabol, followed by an M.Sc. focused on using GIS to map plant diseases in Iran. I later earned my Ph.D. in Plant Pathology Modeling from Lincoln University in New Zealand. Afterward, I completed a postdoc at the University of Florida, collaborating with Professor Ariena van Bruggen, a distinguished scientist in plant pathology, on various research projects.</p>

            <h3><a href="#research">Research</a></h3>
            <p>My research integrates quantitative modeling, GIS, and bioinformatics to address critical questions at the intersection of plant pathology and environmental science. I focus on the spatial distribution of plant diseases, biosecurity, and the impacts of climate change on agricultural systems. My work involves using advanced statistical techniques and machine learning to predict disease outbreaks, assess risks, and develop strategies for sustainable crop protection.</p>
