        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>My research is primarily focused on understanding the complex interactions between biological systems and environmental factors through quantitative modeling. I specialize in plant and animal disease epidemiology, spatial analysis, and ecological modeling. By leveraging advanced modeling techniques, my work aims to predict and mitigate the impact of diseases and environmental changes on ecosystems.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Areas of Research</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Plant Disease Epidemiology</h3>
        <p>I investigate the spread and control of plant diseases using simulation models that incorporate climatic variables, host-pathogen interactions, and landscape features. My goal is to develop tools that help farmers and policymakers make informed decisions to protect crops from emerging threats.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Animal Disease Modeling</h3>
        <p>My work in animal disease modeling focuses on the transmission dynamics of zoonotic diseases. I use statistical and mechanistic models to assess risks, identify hotspots, and inform disease management strategies in livestock and wildlife populations.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Spatial and Ecological Modeling</h3>
        <p>I apply spatial modeling techniques to study the distribution and behavior of species in response to environmental changes. My research includes modeling species distributions under current and future climate scenarios, with an emphasis on conservation planning and biodiversity management.</p>
        
        <h2>Selected Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Climate Adaptation in Agriculture</strong>: Developing models to predict the impact of climate change on crop yields and pest outbreaks.</li>
            <li><strong>Zoonotic Disease Risk Assessment</strong>: Creating spatial models to identify areas at risk for emerging zoonotic diseases.</li>
            <li><strong>Ecosystem Services and Biodiversity</strong>: Modeling the effects of land-use changes on ecosystem services and biodiversity in various regions.</li>
        </ul>
